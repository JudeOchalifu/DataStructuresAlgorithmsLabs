# DataStructuresAlgorithmsLabs

Labs implemented for my CS 136 class, which covered data structures and algorithms.  The lab prompts can be found here: http://dept.cs.williams.edu/~jeannie/cs136/handouts.html.  The assignments ranged from schedulers, to recursive algorithms, and even a "DARWIN" creature selector.
